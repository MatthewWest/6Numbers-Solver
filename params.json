{"name":"6Numbers-solver","tagline":"A program which solves the 6Numbers game of combining numbers to make a goal.","body":"# 6Numbers Solver\r\n\r\nThis small command-line application solves problems of the form seen in the iOS game 6Numbers. The problem consists of a goal number and a collection of other numbers (6Numbers uses 6 numbers, hence its name). The goal is to add, subtract, multiply, and divide the “other numbers” in any order until you reach the goal number, using all or a subset of them.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nIf you have Java, there is no need to install anything. Just download and unzip the ZIP archive. Or even better, fork the repository and improve it!\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nIf you have Clojure and Leiningen installed and want to run the project from source, navigate to the unzipped 6Numbers-Solver folder in the command line and enter \r\n`lein run`.\r\n\r\nIf you’d rather not install Clojure to run the project, navigate to the 6Numbers-Solver/target folder, then run:\r\n\r\n    $ java -jar six-numbers-solver-0.1.0-standalone.jar\r\n    \r\nThen follow the prompts to enter the goal number and collection of numbers. The program will solve them (#FIXME: not always in the most efficient way), and print its solution, then ask if you want to solve another problem.\r\n\r\n## Options\r\n\r\nNo options yet... some may be coming in the future.\r\n\r\n### Bugs\r\n\r\nNo known bugs strictly speaking, just lacks of features.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nCopyright © 2013 Matthew A.
